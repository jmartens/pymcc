# pymcc
module that reads mephisto mcc files from watertank scans or starcheck files. Maybe later an option for 729 measurement files will be added. 

pymcc was created to analyze mcc files from within QATrack+ through an upload test that creates a dict (of dicts), followed by composite tests that grab the individual results from that dict.

## Examples

### Water Tank Profile

```Python
import pymcc

mymcc = 
```


### Starcheck
```Python
import pymcc

mymcc = 
```
